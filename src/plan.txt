General philosophy:
1) Every thread's polling/try_wait/wait begins a process of reaping the completion queue
    a) For single-threaded it will contain an Rc<Refcell<CQ>>
    b) For multi-threaded it will contain a way to wake the reaper thread
2) The user should not have to worry about sync-ing the S or C queue
3) The user should not have to worry about submission
    When a promise is created, the user can rightfully assume that it is being filled automatically.
    Methods which do not submit/do not sync will be available to the user.
